# remember to git pull the latest changes before running the docker-compose command from localhost using docker context to remote dockerhost computer, it uses the file from remote server, not the local file when using docker context

#  docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose-azure.yml -p azure up -d
#  docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose-azure.yml -p azure down

# volumes error: mounting to rootfs happens when 
# using a different docker context, remote to server and run docker-compose up from there
